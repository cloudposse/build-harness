This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions, Codefresh, Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

## Regarding the phase out of `git.io`

Prior to April 25, 2022, practically all Cloud Posse Makefiles pulled in a common Makefile via
```
curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"
```

The `git.io` service is a link shortener/redirector provided by GitHub, but [they no longer support it](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation/).
We have therefore set up `https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness` as an alternative and are migrating
all our Makefiles to use that URL instead. We encourage you to update any references you have in your
own code derived from our code, whether by forking one of our repos or simply following one of our examples.

Full details are available in our [`git.io` deprecation documentation](docs/git-io-deprecation.md).

*Example of using the `build-harness` to build a docker image*






## Usage



At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

## GitHub Actions

The `build-harness` is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Here's an example of running `make readme/lint`

```yaml
name: build-harness/readme/lint
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    name: 'Lint README.md'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: cloudposse/build-harness@master
      with:
        entrypoint: /usr/bin/make
        args: readme/lint
 ```

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...

1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness/)


## Examples

Here are some real world examples:
- [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
- [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
- [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
- [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets

## Extending `build-harness` with targets from another repo

It is possible to extend the `build-harness` with targets and entire modules of your own, without having to fork or modify `build-harness` itself.
This might be useful if, for example, you wanted to maintain some tooling that was specific to your environment that didn't have enough general applicability to be part of the main project.
This makes it so you don't necessarily need to fork `build-harness` itself - you can place a repo defined by the environment variable `BUILD_HARNESS_EXTENSIONS_PATH` (a filesystem peer of `build-harness` named `build-harness-extensions` by default) and populate it with tools in the same `Makefile` within `module` structure as `build-harness` has.
Modules will be combined and available with a unified `make` command. 
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
## Using the "auto-init" feature

Typically, the `build-harness` project requires running `make init` before any of the Makefile targets can be invoked. The `init` target will "install" the `build-harness` project and "include" the `Makefile` from the `build-harness` project.

Alternatively, the "auto-init" feature can automatically run the `init` logic for you to install the `build-harness` and help keep the install up-to-date. This feature is enabled using the env or Makefile variable `BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT=true`. By default, this feature is disabled; to enable it, you must set the variable yourself.

**Note:** The "auto-init" feature is a convenience for running `make` interactively. Regardless of your setting of `BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT`, "auto-init" will be disabled if `make` is running inside a Docker container. Scripts and automation should continue to call `make init` explicitly. 

```make
BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT = true

-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

The "auto-init" feature will _also_ keep the install up-to-date. It will check the value of `BUILD_HARNESS_BRANCH`, get the commit ID, compare that to the current checkout, and update the clone if they differ. A useful side-effect is that it becomes easy to pin to versions of the `build-harness` from your own project, and let the `build-harness` update itself as you update the pin:

```make
BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT = true
BUILD_HARNESS_BRANCH = {TAG}

-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

Now when you run `make` the project will update itself to use the version specified by the `BUILD_HARNESS_BRANCH` value:

```sh
$ make help

# GIT.IO DEPRECATION

On April 25, 2022, GitHub announced that the [`git.io` redirector service would be shutting down on 2022-04-29](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation/), merely 4 days later. The announcement said that all references to `git.io` 
would stop working that day.

This was a major breaking change for Cloud Posse, because *all* of our standard Makefiles include a Makefile from this `build-harness`
project explicitly, by downloading (via `curl`) `https://git.io/build-harness`, meaning all our Makefiles would
break once that link stopped redirecting to the appropriate content.

Cloud Posse quickly set up `https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness` as a long-term replacement for `git.io`
and undertook an emergency update of all of our repositories to make this change.

While we were largely successful in updating our repositories by 2022-04-29, Cloud Posse was not fully prepared to make the
mass updates across all of our repositories that this required, so some repositories were not updated in time. Furthermore,
even if all of Cloud Posse's repositories were updated, that would not affect anyone's fork or clone or 
locally checked-out version, so we are publishing the instructions below to help you update your own code.

Fortunately, GitHub recognized the massive upheaval and loss that would be caused by completely shutting down
an URL shorting/link redirecting service, and reversed their decision to shut down `git.io` completely. Instead,
they agreed to archive the links and continue to serve existing links indefinitely, with the caveat that they
would remove links on a case-by-case basis if they were found to be malicious, misleading, or broken. 

This means that instead of being an urgent requirement that you immediately change your links, or else your builds would break,
it is now merely a recommended best practice that you update to the new link that Cloud Posse controls and 
is committed to maintaining. 

Specifically, in source files you control, you should update all references to `git.io/build-harness`
to instead refer to `cloudposse.tools/build-harness`. Critical references are in Makefiles, and there are also 
important references in README files that describe Makefiles. References in derived or downloaded files, such as 
Terraform modules downloaded by `terraform init`, do not need to be modified.
Below we provide guidance on how to make the replacements.

## Automating the update process

In all cases, these commands are intended to be run from a directory at the top of the directory tree
under which all your potentially affected code resides. Usually either the top-level directory of a single `git` repo
or a `src` (or similar) directory under which you have all your `git` repos (directly or in subdirectories).

### Finding affected files

Use the following command to find all occurrences in all directories recursively:
```
grep -l "git\.io/build-harness" -R .
```
Note that the above command can reach very deeply, such as into Terraform modules you have downloaded. You may want to impose some limits.
If you run from the top level of a `git` repo, where there is a `Makefile` and a `Dockerfile`, you can reduce that to
```
grep -l "git\.io/build-harness" *
```
If you have a lot of Cloud Posse projects under a single directory, then you might try
```
grep -l "git\.io/build-harness" * */*
```
or for full depth below the current directory
```
find . \( -name .terraform -prune -type f \)  -o \( -name build-harness -prune -type f \) -o \( -name 'Makefile*' -o -name 'README*' \) -type f
```

### Updating the affected files

Once you are happy with the command to generate the list of files to update, update the files by inserting that command into this command template:
```
sed -i '' 's/git.io\/build-harness/cloudposse.tools\/build-harness/' $(<command to list files>)
```

#### Examples

The quickest update will be if you only have a single project to update, in which case you can `cd` into the project root directory and
```
sed -i '' 's/git.io\/build-harness/cloudposse.tools\/build-harness/' $(grep -l "git\.io/build-harness" *)
```

If you have multiple projects to update and want to be thorough, then this is probably best:
```
sed -i '' 's/git.io\/build-harness/cloudposse.tools\/build-harness/' $(find . \( -name .terraform -prune -type f \)  -o \( -name build-harness -prune -type f \) -o \( -name 'Makefile*' -o -name 'README*' \) -type f )
```

This is the most thorough, but probably overkill for most people:
```
sed -i '' 's/git.io\/build-harness/cloudposse.tools\/build-harness/' $(grep -l "git\.io/build-harness" -R .)
```
