# Build Maker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neildmorris/build-maker.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/neildmorris/build-maker)

This `build-maker` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Jekyll, Terraform, and more.

It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under [APACHE2](LICENSE).


## Usage

At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-maker "https://git.io/build-maker"; echo .build-maker)
```

This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-maker` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-maker` file to your `.gitignore`.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

$ make help
