  ** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
  **
  ** This file was automatically generated by the `cloudposse/build-harness`.
  ** 1) Make all changes to `README.yaml`
  ** 2) Run `make init` (you only need to do this once)
  ** 3) Run`make readme` to rebuild this file.

This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building READMEs, Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions.

## Usage


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Regarding the phase out of `git.io`**
> Prior to April 25, 2022, practically all Cloud Posse Makefiles pulled in a common Makefile via
> ```bash
> curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"
> ```
> 
> The `git.io` service is a link shortener/redirector provided by GitHub, but [they no longer support it](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation/).
> We have therefore set up `https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness` as an alternative and are migrating
> all our Makefiles to use that URL instead. We encourage you to update any references you have in your
> own code derived from our code, whether by forking one of our repos or simply following one of our examples.
> 
> Full details are available in our [`git.io` deprecation documentation](docs/git-io-deprecation.md).

At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

## GitHub Actions

The `build-harness` is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Here's an example of running `make readme/lint`

```yaml
name: build-harness/readme/lint
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    name: 'Lint README.md'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: cloudposse/build-harness@master
      with:
        entrypoint: /usr/bin/make
        args: readme/lint
 ```


## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...

1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness/)
## Examples

Here is a real world example:
- [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets

## Extending `build-harness` with targets from another repo

It is possible to extend the `build-harness` with targets and entire modules of your own, without having to fork or modify `build-harness` itself.
This might be useful if, for example, you wanted to maintain some tooling that was specific to your environment that didn't have enough general applicability to be part of the main project.
This makes it so you don't necessarily need to fork `build-harness` itself - you can place a repo defined by the environment variable `BUILD_HARNESS_EXTENSIONS_PATH` (a filesystem peer of `build-harness` named `build-harness-extensions` by default) and populate it with tools in the same `Makefile` within `module` structure as `build-harness` has.
Modules will be combined and available with a unified `make` command. 
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
## Using the "auto-init" feature

Typically, the `build-harness` project requires running `make init` before any of the Makefile targets can be invoked. The `init` target will "install" the `build-harness` project and "include" the `Makefile` from the `build-harness` project.

Alternatively, the "auto-init" feature can automatically run the `init` logic for you to install the `build-harness` and help keep the install up-to-date. This feature is enabled using the env or Makefile variable `BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT=true`. By default, this feature is disabled; to enable it, you must set the variable yourself.

**Note:** The "auto-init" feature is a convenience for running `make` interactively. Regardless of your setting of `BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT`, "auto-init" will be disabled if `make` is running inside a Docker container. Scripts and automation should continue to call `make init` explicitly. 

```make
BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT = true

-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

The "auto-init" feature will _also_ keep the install up-to-date. It will check the value of `BUILD_HARNESS_BRANCH`, get the commit ID, compare that to the current checkout, and update the clone if they differ. A useful side-effect is that it becomes easy to pin to versions of the `build-harness` from your own project, and let the `build-harness` update itself as you update the pin:

```make
BUILD_HARNESS_AUTO_INIT = true
BUILD_HARNESS_BRANCH = {TAG}

-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

Now when you run `make` the project will update itself to use the version specified by the `BUILD_HARNESS_BRANCH` value:

```sh
$ make help
