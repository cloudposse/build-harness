# Build Harness [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/build-harness.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/build-harness) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/build-harness.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).








## Screenshots

*Example of using the `build-harness` to build a docker image*



## Usage

At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...

1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness/)


## Examples

Here are some real world examples:
- [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
- [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
- [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
- [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets
