# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
  It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here are some real world examples:
  - [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
  - [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
  - [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
  - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets
