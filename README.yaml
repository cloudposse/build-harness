# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
  It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions, Codefresh, Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.
  
  ## Regarding the phase out of `git.io`

  Prior to April 25, 2022, practically all Cloud Posse Makefiles pulled in a common Makefile via
  ```
  curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"
  ```
  
  The `git.io` service is a link shortener/redirector provided by GitHub, but [they no longer support it](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation/).
  We have therefore set up `https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness` as an alternative and are migrating
  all our Makefiles to use that URL instead. We encourage you to update any references you have in your
  own code derived from our code, whether by forking one of our repos or simply following one of our examples.
  
  Full details are available in our [`git.io` deprecation documentation](docs/git-io-deprecation.md).

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

  ## GitHub Actions
 
  The `build-harness` is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

  Here's an example of running `make readme/lint`

  ```yaml
  name: build-harness/readme/lint
  on: [pull_request]
  jobs:
    build:
      name: 'Lint README.md'
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: cloudposse/build-harness@master
        with:
          entrypoint: /usr/bin/make
          args: readme/lint
   ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here are some real world examples:
  - [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
  - [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
  - [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
  - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets

# How to get started quickly
quickstart: |-
  Here's how to get started...

  1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
  2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness/)
