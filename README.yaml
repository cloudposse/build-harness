# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building READMEs, Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
  It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions.
  
# Introduction to the project

#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > **Regarding the phase out of `git.io`**
  > Prior to April 25, 2022, practically all Cloud Posse Makefiles pulled in a common Makefile via
  > ```bash
  > curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"
  > ```
  > 
  > The `git.io` service is a link shortener/redirector provided by GitHub, but [they no longer support it](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-25-git-io-deprecation/).
  > We have therefore set up `https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness` as an alternative and are migrating
  > all our Makefiles to use that URL instead. We encourage you to update any references you have in your
  > own code derived from our code, whether by forking one of our repos or simply following one of our examples.
  > 
  > Full details are available in our [`git.io` deprecation documentation](docs/git-io-deprecation.md).

  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://cloudposse.tools/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

  ## GitHub Actions
 
  The `build-harness` is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

  Here's an example of running `make readme/lint`

  ```yaml
  name: build-harness/readme/lint
  on: [pull_request]
  jobs:
    build:
      name: 'Lint README.md'
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: cloudposse/build-harness@master
        with:
          entrypoint: /usr/bin/make
          args: readme/lint
   ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is a real world example:
  - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets

# How to get started quickly
quickstart: |-
  Here's how to get started...

  1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
  2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness/)
