# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building README files and can be expanded to do more.
  It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions, Codefresh, Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

# Introduction to the project
# introduction: |-
#   This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  **Ensure you have [`fetch`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch) installed and in your path.**

  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell fetch --log-level=error --repo=https://github.com/bitdefendermdr/build-harness --source-path=templates/Makefile.build-harness --branch=master .build-harness; echo .build-harness)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at runtime. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

  Run `make readme/init` to create a generic README.yml. Update content with the details of what should be in the README.md

  Run `make readme` to build the README.md. **This will overwrite the current README.md if one exists.**

  Run `make docs/targets.md` and `make docs/terraform.md` to generate the `targets.md` and `terraform.md`.

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is an example:
  - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `readme`, `terraform/%` and `docs/%` targets. Some of the `terraform/%` targets were removed and some new targets were added.

# How to get started quickly
quickstart: |-
  Here's how to get started...

  1. `git clone git@github.com:BitdefenderMDR/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
  1. `make init` to intialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/BitdefenderMDR/build-harness)
