# Cloud Posse Build Harness [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/build-harness.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/build-harness)
{{ (datasource "section").warning }}

This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.

It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under [APACHE2](LICENSE).


## Usage

At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names
